        <p>All Phing reference documentation is written using the DocBook5 XML markup (see <a class="ulink" href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">DocBook Project</a>). The main
            advantage with DocBook is that it is a single source but multiple outputs. These
            document sources can be rendered into many possible output formats such as (X)HTML, PDF,
            EPub, Webhelp, RTF, Text and many more. Another advantage, inherit with the text based
            XML format, is that the document sources are all completely text based written using
            UTF-8 encoding. Only a plain text editor is required to extend or edit this
            documentation. </p>
        <p>However, XML tends to be quite verbose and even if a plain text editor technically is
            all that is needed the actual entering of text will be made much easier with custom XML
            editor. These editors can be used to hide the XML tags and do auto-completion and
            on-the-fly validation to make sure that what is written is a valid DocBook5
            document.</p>
        <p>To work with the documentation we recommend to use one of the free XML/DocBook aware
            editors available. For example</p>

        <p>The sources for the documentation are included under the
                <code class="literal">docs/docbook5</code> directory. The DocBook sources are split into
            several files in order to make it more maintainable using the XML standard
                <code class="literal">XInclude</code> (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/" target="_top">XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0</a>).</p>

            <p>In order to build the documentation it is necessary to have the DocBook5 XSL
                stylesheets installed together with "<code class="literal">xsltproc</code>" which is used to
                transform the source into various output formats. In addition, to build the versions
                (either HTML or PDF) that supports highlighting of included source (within the
                    <code class="literal">&lt;programlisting&gt;</code> element) the <code class="literal">Saxon
                    6.5.5</code> XSL processor must be used. This is necessary since the syntax
                highlighting in DocBook is based on a Java extension
                    (<code class="literal">xslthl-2.x.x</code>) which requires a Java based processor (such as
                Saxon).</p>
            <p>
                </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to setup a complete build environment for DocBook5 for
                        people new to DocBook is to install a clean version of Debian 7.x and then
                        run the "<code class="filename">deb-setup.sh</code>" shell script. This will create a
                        fully tested and working build environment for DocBook5 as it is used with
                        Phing. This could easily be done using a virtual setup  (for example using
                        VirtualBox).</p>
                </div><p>
            </p>
            <p>All DocBook sources are structured in a tree under <code class="filename">docs/docbook5</code>. The top level is the language of the manual. As of
                this writing only an English manual is available and hence the only top level
                directory available is "<code class="literal">en</code>". Under this directory the following
                structure applies (also for any new language translation that is added):</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">|-- scripts
|-- source
|   |-- appendixes
|   `-- chapters
`-- stylesheets
    |-- css
    |   `-- img
    `-- xsl
        `-- images</pre>
            <p>All document sources are stored under the subdirectory "<code class="filename">source</code>" and the master document is aptly named
                    "<code class="filename">master.xml</code>". This document pulls in all chapters and
                appendixes in the right order. For example, new tasks added should normally be
                documented in the "<code class="filename">appendix/optionaltasks.xml</code>" file. Look at
                the existing tasks and follow the same structure.</p>
            <div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
                <p>In order to get highlighting to work both the
                        "<code class="filename">xslthl-2.x.x.jar</code>" package must be installed as well as
                    Saxon 6.5.x. The jar file must be installed somewhere in the
                        <code class="literal">CLASSPATH</code> , for example "<code class="filename">/usr/share/java</code>" if you run this on Linux. The xslthl package is
                    available on SourceForge, please see <a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslthl/" target="_top">XSLT syntax
                        highlighting</a>. By using the automated setup for Debian 7.x all these
                    dependencies will be taken care of!</p>
            </div>
            <p>The customized stylesheets used are stored under "<code class="filename">stylesheets</code>" which uses one sub-folder for the customized XSL
                stylesheets (responsible for the transformation from DocBook to the chosen output
                format) and one sub-folder for the CSS stylesheets used to give the generated HTML
                documents there "<span class="emphasis"><em>look &amp; feel</em></span>".</p>
            <p>Finally the "<code class="filename">scripts</code>" directory stores utility
                scripts. This currently contains two scripts, <code class="literal">deb-setup.sh</code> and
                    "<code class="literal">hlsaxon</code>". The first scripts helps to create a full build
                environment for DocBook5 starting with a clean Debian 7 installation. This is meant
                to help people new to DocBook5 to get a working build environment as easy as
                possible.  This script takes care of all detailed setup and will make a fulloy
                working DocBook5 build environment out-of-the-box. </p>
            <p>The second script (<code class="literal">hlsaxon</code>) is wrapper file used from the
                buildfiles to call the Saxon translator (a Java based XSL procesor) with
                highlighting enabled and suitable paths to supporting libraries  In this script the
                path to the DocBook installed stylesheets must be adjusted depending on your system
                (unless the automated setup have been used - with the
                    <code class="filename">deb-setup.sh</code> file which takes care of that setup
                automatically). Mutatis mutandis.</p>
            <p>In order to drive the transformation a Phing build script is available in the
                docbook root, <code class="filename">build.xml</code>. The build script supports the
                following public targets</p>
            <pre class="programlisting"> all*         Builds all available targets (default)

            <p>All generated output is stored under the directory "<code class="filename">output</code>" (which is created if it doesn't exist) with a subdirectory

            <p>For creating documentation for new tasks the easistes thing is to use the included

                all commonly used elements. This will ensure a correct setting of all attributes.

                </div><p>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, by necessity this assumes a rudimentary knowledge of Docbook5 bubild
                process and what XSL and CSS stylesheets are. It is not possible in this short space
                to give a full description of that setup. </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>XSL Customization layer</strong></span></p>
            <p>All DocBook5 renderings are started from one of the customized XSL stylesheet
                under "<code class="literal">stylesheets/xsl</code>" . All commonly adjusted properties should
                go into the appropriate stylesheet for that rendering. No properties should be
                passed on via the command line. To keep the customization layer as future proof as
                possible only in very rare circumstances should any cores XSL templates be copied
                and modified. As usual the recommended way is to use the provided hooks.</p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>CSS styelsheets</strong></span></p>
            <p>The CSS stylesheets are used to create the look &amp; feel for the HTML based
                renderings. These are entirely standard CSS files which by design are kept very
                simple. It should be noted that a few styling option depends in turn of the modified
                XSL transformations in the XSL customization layer. This had to be done in order to
                gain some more detialed control not provided by DocBook5 out-of-the-box.</p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Webhelp</strong></span></p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">webhelp</code> output rendering is a bit of a special case. This
                rendering depends not only on DocBook5 but also on Java as well as Ant build
                processor. These dependencies are inherited from the official DocBook5 webhelp
                process and will remain. Unfortunately adjusting the look &amp; fell for this
                rendering is not as simple as for the other outputs since a fair amount of the
                layout (as well as look &amp; feel) are hard-coded in the Webhelp build system.
                While it is perfectly possible to adjust the hard coded values and design choises it
                is not future proof. Since the Webhelp rendering is the newest and fastest improving
                output from DocBook the intention for the Phing documentation is to track these
                improvements and not spend time ourself to duplicate this effor with a parallell
                development.</p>

            <p>To keep things simple the manual uses only a small subset of all available

                with adding and editing the manual. It also helps to keep the look&amp;feel

                                    <code class="literal">&lt;sect1&gt;</code> element and each example section
                                for the task must be contained within a
                                    <code class="literal">&lt;sect2&gt;</code> element. Depending on the
                                description needed for each task additional
                                    <code class="literal">&lt;sect2&gt;</code> may be added as needed to make the
                                text logically structured. If needed, a further nesting level may be
                                used by using <code class="literal">&lt;sect3&gt;</code> elements within each
                                    <code class="literal">&lt;sect2&gt;</code> element. No deeper nestings than
                                    <code class="literal">&lt;sect3&gt;</code> should ever be used.</p>
                            <p>Each top level section must have the <code class="literal">xml:id</code>
                                attribute which is used to reference the section from other parts of
                                the document. Each section must have a nested title element.</p>
