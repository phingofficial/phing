        <p><acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym> was originally a subproject of Binarycloud. Binarycloud is a
            highly engineered application framework, designed for use in enterprise environments.
            Binarycloud uses XML extensively for storing metadata about a project (configuration,
            nodes, widgets, site structure, etc.). Because Binarycloud is built for PHP, performing
            extensive XML processing and transformations on each page request is an unrealistic
            proposition. Phing is used to "compile" the XML metadata into PHP arrays that
            can be processed without overhead by PHP scripts.</p>
        <p>Of course, XML compilation is only one of many ways that Binarycloud uses the
                <acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym> build system. The <acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym> build system
            makes it possible for you to:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
                <p>Build multi language pages from one source tree,</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Centralize metadata (e.g. your data model) in one XML file and generate
                    several files from that XML with different XSLT.</p>
            </li></ul></div>
        <p>It the beginning, Binarycloud used the GNU make system; however, this approach had
            some drawbacks: The space-before-tab-problem in makefiles, the fact that it is only
            natively available for Unix systems etc. So, the need for a better build system arose.
            Due to its XML build files and modular design, Apache Ant was a logical choice.
            The problem was that Ant is written in Java, so you need to install a JVM on your
            computer to use it. Besides the need for yet another interpreter (i.e. besides PHP),
            there was also legal/ideological conflict in requiring a commercial JVM (there were
            problems with Ant on JVMs other than Sun's) for an LGPL'd Binarycloud.</p>
        <p>So, the development of <acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym> began. <acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym> is a
            build system written in PHP and uses the ideas of Ant. The first release was designed
            &amp; developed simultaneously, and thus not very sophisticated. This original system
            was quickly pushed to its limits and the need for a better Phing became a priority.
            Andreas Aderhold, who was responsible for <acronym class="acronym">Phing</acronym>/r1, designed and
            wrote much of the Phing/r2 that followed. Phing/r2 became the Phing-1.0 that exists
            today for PHP4.</p>
        <p>The current development version of <acronym class="acronym">Phing 2.x</acronym>, requires
                <acronym class="acronym">PHP5</acronym> (at least 5.2.x) and makes use of many of the available
            features in PHP5.2 to achieve a high degree of modularization, code efficiency as well
            as stability and testability.</p>
