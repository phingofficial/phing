        <title>What Phing Is</title>
        <para><acronym>Phing</acronym> is a project build system based on Apache ant (See <xref
                xlink:href="#ant" xlink:title="[ant]"/>). You can do anything with
                <acronym>Phing</acronym> that you could do with a traditional build system like Gnu
            make (See <xref xlink:href="#gnumake" xlink:title="[gmake]"/>), and 
            <acronym>Phing's</acronym> use of
            simple XML build files and extensible PHP task classes make it an easy-to-use and highly
            flexible build framework.</para>
        <para>Because <acronym>Phing</acronym> is based on Ant, parts of this manual are also
            adapted from the ant manual (see <xref xlink:href="#ant" xlink:title="[ant]"/>). We are
            extremely grateful to the folks in the Ant project for creating (and continuing to
            create) such an inspiring build system model, and for the open-source licensing that
            makes it possible for us to learn from each other and build increasingly better tools.</para>

        <title>Phing &amp; Binarycloud: History</title>
        <para><acronym>Phing</acronym> was originally a subproject of Binarycloud. Binarycloud is a
            highly engineered application framework, designed for use in enterprise environments.
            Binarycloud uses XML extensively for storing metadata about a project (configuration,
            nodes, widgets, site structure, etc.). Because Binarycloud is built for PHP, performing
            extensive XML processing and transformations on each page request is an unrealistic
            proposition. Phing is used to &quot;compile&quot; the XML metadata into PHP arrays that
            can be processed without overhead by PHP scripts.</para>
        <para>Of course, XML compilation is only one of many ways that Binarycloud uses the
                <acronym>Phing</acronym> build system. The <acronym>Phing</acronym> build system
            makes it possible for you to:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Build multi language pages from one source tree,</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Centralize metadata (e.g. your data model) in one XML file and generate
                    several files from that XML with different XSLT.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>It the beginning, Binarycloud used the GNU make system; however, this approach had
            some drawbacks: The space-before-tab-problem in makefiles, the fact that it is only
            natively available for Unix systems etc. So, the need for a better build system arose.
            Apache Ant was a logical choice -- do to its use of XML build files and modular design.
            The problem was that Ant is written in Java, so you need to install a JVM on your
            computer to use it. Besides the need for yet another interpreter (i.e. besides PHP),
            there was also legal/ideological conflict in requiring a commercial JVM (there were
            problems with Ant on JVMs other than Sun's) for an LGPL'd Binarycloud.</para>
        <para>So, the development of <acronym>Phing</acronym> began. <acronym>Phing</acronym> is a
            build system written in PHP and uses the ideas of Ant. The first release was designed
            &amp; developed simultaneously, and thus not very sophisticated. This original system
            was quickly pushed to its limits and the need for a better Phing became a priority.
            Andreas Aderhold, who was responsible for <acronym>Phing</acronym>/r1, designed and
            wrote much of the Phing/r2 that followed. Phing/r2 became the Phing-1.0 that exists
            today for PHP4.</para>
        <para>The current development of <acronym>Phing</acronym> is focused on <acronym>Phing
                2</acronym>, which has involved a number of bugfixes, functionality enhancements,
            and most significantly a conversion of the codebase to use new <acronym>PHP5</acronym>
            features such as abstract classes, interfaces, and try/catch/throw exception
            handling.</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>How Phing Works</title>
        <para><acronym>Phing</acronym> uses XML buildfiles that contain a description of the things
            to do. The buildfile is structured into targets that contain the actual commands to
            perform (e.g. commands to copy a file, delete a directory, perform a DB query, etc.).
            So, to use <acronym>Phing</acronym>, you would first write your buildfile and then you
            would run phing, specifying the target in your buildfile that you want to execute.</para>
        <screen>% phing -f mybuildfile.xml mytarget</screen>
        <para>By default <acronym>Phing</acronym> will look for a buildfile named
                <filename>build.xml</filename> (so you don't have to specify the buildfile name
            unless it is not <filename>build.xml</filename>) and if no target is specified
                <acronym>Phing</acronym> will try to execute the default target, as specified in the
                <literal>&lt;project></literal> tag.</para>

        <title>Cool, so how can I help?</title>
        <para><acronym>Phing</acronym> is under active development and there are many things to be
            done. To get involved, you can start by doing the following:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Read this manual to understand <acronym>Phing</acronym> ;-)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Go to <link xlink:href="http://phing.tigris.org"
                        >http://phing.tigris.org</link> and subscribe to the <literal>dev</literal>
