  Thank you for using PHING!

  **PH**ing **I**s **N**ot **G**NU make; it's a PHP project build system or build tool based on Apache Ant. You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.

  Features include running PHPUnit unit tests (including test result and coverage reports), file transformations (e.g. token replacement, XSLT transformation, template transformations), file system operations, interactive build support, SQL execution, SCM operations (Git, Subversion and Mercurial), documentation generation (PhpDocumentor, ApiGen) and much, much more.

  If you find yourself writing custom scripts to handle the packaging, deploying, or testing of your applications, then we suggest looking at Phing. Pre-packaged with numerous out-of-the-box operation modules (tasks), and an easy-to-use OO model to extend or add your own custom tasks.

  For more information and documentation, you can visit our official website at <https://www.phing.info/>.

## Supported PHP versions

  Phing 3.x is compatible with PHP 8.1 and higher.

## Installation

  1. **Composer**

  The preferred method to install Phing is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
  Add [phing/phing](https://packagist.org/packages/phing/phing) to the
  require-dev or require section of your project's `composer.json`
  configuration file, and run 'composer install':

         {
             "require-dev": {
                 "phing/phing": "3.1.x-dev"
             }
         }

  2. **Phar**

  Download the [Phar archive](https://www.phing.info/get/phing-latest.phar).
  The archive can then be executed by running:

         $ php phing-latest.phar

  3. **Docker** (experimental)

  The official Phing Docker image can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phing/phing/).

  To execute Phing inside a container and execute `build.xml` located in `/home/user`, run the following:

         $ docker run --rm -v /home/user:/opt phing/phing:3.0 -f /opt/build.xml

  4. **Phing GitHub Action**
  
  The official GitHub action [phingofficial/phing-github-action](https://github.com/phingofficial/phing-github-action) is available on [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-a-phing-build).
  
  To *Run a Phing Build* as an action, you need to setup a `.github/workflow/phing.yml` workflow file and paste the following snipped:

     name: CI
     on: [ push ]
     jobs:
       build-test:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Phing Build
             uses: phingofficial/phing-github-action@v2.0.0
             with:
               version: 3.0.0-alpha4
               user-properties: prop=FooBar
               targets: foo
